  title: "Advancing Personal Fabrication by Making Physical Objects as Reprogrammable as Digital Data"
  abstract: "Computing has revolutionized how we process and interact with data today, unfortunately, these capabilities are constraint to the digital realm and cannot yet be applied to physical matter. For instance, today, we can already quickly update the appearance of a digital photo by applying a filter or adding and removing elements. However, updating physical objects in the same way is not possible today. In this talk, I will show my research group’s latest developments that bring us closer to a future in which physical objects are as reprogrammable as data is today. As a first example of this, I will show our research on a new reprogrammable material that can be applied to the surface of physical objects and that allows them to change their appearance within a few minutes. This allows us to update the color of clothing, shoes, and even entire rooms in the same way as we can update a digital photo today. I will then show additional developments that extend this concept to further integrate computing capabilities into physical objects, show our research on how we can print functional objects in one go without the need for assembly, and demonstrate how we can create unified prototyping environments that support engineers and designers in fabricating new types of physical objects."

  title: "Beyond Visualization Wizardry: The Role of Interaction in Data Visualization"
  abstract: "Visualization is not just a way of creating pretty pictures and \"intuitive dashboards\". It is not a magic wand that you can apply to your dataset to automatically turn a data mess into \"actionable insights for transformative results\". Far from this wizardry, I argue that understanding data comes at the cost of interacting with it. I will go through several research projects - ranging from manual reordering of matrices to active reading of visualizations to interaction discoverability to composite physicalizations to direct manipulation of graphical encodings - in an attempt to convince you that we can, and should, find better ways for people to interact with data visualizations."

  title: "The Immersive Canvas: Data Visualization and Interaction for Immersive Analytics"
  abstract: "This talk explores the role of interactive data visualization for immersive analytics. Immersive analytics is becoming a complex field that combines many fields of expertise: analytics, big data, infrastructure, virtual and augmented systems, image recognition and many others, as well as human-computer interaction and visualization. In order to make sense of complex data, we need visualization interfaces: in immersive environments, data visualization is freed of the limitedness of the traditional desktop screen; able to expand into an infinite canvas and the third dimension. What potential does this bring for data visualization and immersive visualization? How can we leverage this potential? How is this changing our approach to visualizing and interacting with data?"

  title: "Warning, This robot is not what it seems! A discussion on deception and the future of social robots"
  abstract: "Social robots are designed to interact with people using human- or animal-like language, gestures, or other techniques. This approach promises intuitive interaction, and can be designed to shape a person's mood and behavior; social robots can even serve as companions. However, I argue that social robots - by design - are fundamentally rooted in deception, which highlights real potential dangers as these robots enter society. On the flip side, considering this deception also provides a positive way forward, a path for developing social robots that can be successful in both our everyday lives."

  title: "On Body & Out of Body Interactions"
  abstract: "Mobile devices have become ubiquitous over the last decade, changing the way we interact with technology and with one another. Mobile devices were at first personal devices carried in our hands or pockets. They are now changing form to fit our lifestyles and an increasingly demanding amount and diversity of information to display. My research focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of novel interaction techniques with mobile devices using a human-centered approach. In this presentation, I will in particular focus on two types of mobile technologies: wearables and drones. I will discuss the use of multiple modalities to interact with technology and in particular how haptics on wearables can support long-term tasks without interrupting the user’s attention. I will then discuss how autonomous devices such as drones re-invent our understanding of ubiquitous computing and present my current research on collocated natural human-drone interaction."

  title: "Soft Infrastructures"
  abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of existing models of housing, collective life, and infrastructure. The 99% have been disproportionately marginalized by shelter-in-place orders and quarantines that assume they have the resources to weather this moment of extreme instability. The transition from a quarantine to a post-pandemic city will not only be a fight for collective human health and wellbeing, but will also be the staging ground for our last stand to prevent a forthcoming climate catastrophe. New paradigms of urban design and civic infrastructure must be decoupled from society’s carbon-intensive practices and archaic fetishes for \"solidity\" in building. \"Soft Infrastructures\" present an alternative modality for urban design. This lecture will discuss three on-going projects by the Center for Civilization: Civic Commons Catalyst, Eternal Ephemera, and Soft City/Soft Haus."

  title: Dynamic Graphics as a Language
  abstract: "How can we make animation as easy as sketching? How can we create dynamic contents in real-time, in the speed of thought? How will dynamic graphics shape our real-time communications and language? In this talk, I'm going to present my research on animation, storytelling, and design, including the design of Sketchbook Motion that was crowned as \"The best iPad app of the year 2016\" by Apple. Most of us experience the power of animated media every day: animation makes it easy to communicate complex ideas beyond verbal language. However, only few of us have the skills to express ourselves through this medium. By making animation as easy, accessible, and fluid as sketching, I intend to make dynamic graphics a powerful medium to think, create, and communicate rapidly."

  title: "Creating Smart Everyday Things"
  abstract: "In my vision, the user interfaces of the future are in a blend of smart physical and virtual environments. My research focuses on the physical side by bringing interactivity to everyday things. I believe this vision is only achievable if people with varying backgrounds and abilities can work together in an accessible and collaborative environment. In this talk, I will describe two major threads of research in interactive everyday things and hardware prototyping tools. The first thread investigates interactive systems to sense the context of use of the things or estimate a user’s intention when touch input data is noisy. For example, I will demonstrate a tablecloth augmented with a fabric sensor that can sense and recognize non-metallic objects placed on a table, such as food, different types of fruits, liquids, plastic, and paper products. I will also show examples of how this technique can be used for contextual applications. The second thread investigates tools to lower the bar of entry to prototyping electronics, which is an essential skill needed to create smart everyday things. The goal of this line of work is to enable more people with varying backgrounds and abilities to create smart everyday things and eventually a better user experience of smart environments. For example, I will demonstrate an audio-tactile tutorial system for blind or low vision learners to understand circuit diagrams, which is an important task in the circuit prototyping pipeline. Both of these threads share a common goal that is to create a better user experience in smart environments."

  title: "'Mechanical Shells' for Actuated Tangible UIs - Hybrid Architecture of Active and Passive Machines for Interaction Design"
  abstract: "Research on actuated and shape-changing Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) in the field of HCI has been explored widely in the past few decades to enrich interaction with digital information in physical and dynamic ways. In this effort, various types of generic devices of actuated TUIs have been investigated including pin-based shape displays, actuated curve interfaces, and swarm user interfaces. While these approaches are intended to be dynamically reconfigurable to offer generic interactivity, each hardware is inherently limited to the fixed configurations. How can we further expand the versatility of the actuated TUIs for fully expanding their capability for tangible interactions and motion / shape representations?\n\nIn my talk, I propose a ‘mechanical shell’, a design concept for actuated TUIs with modular interchangeable components that extends and converts the shape, motion, and interactivity of the hardware. By doing so, compared with the actuated TUI itself, each mechanical shell would bring much more specialized and customized interactivity, while, as the whole architecture, the system can adapt to much more versatile interactions. I present two research instances that demonstrate this concept based-on pin-based shape display and swarm user interface, and introduce proof-of-concept implementation as well as a range of applications. By introducing the novel interaction architecture, my research envisions the future of the physical environment where active and passive machines exist together for enriching tangible and embodied interactions."
